# Actuarial Continuing Education - Bias Guidance

## Overview
This document outlines bias activities that qualify for actuarial continuing education (CE) credit, as defined by USQS and Humana guidance. The main purpose is to spread awareness of Databricks capabilities while providing knowledge and perspective to assist actuaries in identifying and assessing biases in data, assumptions, algorithms, and models.

## Bias Definition
Bias activities are those that provide knowledge and perspective to assist actuaries in identifying and assessing biases that may exist in:
- Data
- Assumptions  
- Algorithms
- Models impacting actuarial services

Biases may include, but are not limited to:
- Statistical biases
- Cognitive biases
- Social biases

## Categories of Bias Activities

### 1. Statistical Bias
**Training or webinars on identifying and mitigating issues like:**
- Survivorship bias
- Selection bias
- Data bias in actuarial models

**Examples:**
- Survivorship bias in claims data analysis
- Selection bias in member enrollment patterns
- Data bias in healthcare cost projections

### 2. Cognitive Bias
**Sessions on decision-making biases relevant to actuarial work:**
- Anchoring bias
- Confirmation bias
- Other decision-making biases

**Examples:**
- Anchoring bias in premium rate setting
- Confirmation bias in model validation
- Availability bias in risk assessment

### 3. Social Bias
**Education in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI):**
- Training on racial bias in healthcare data
- Understanding social determinants of health
- Impact on actuarial assumptions

**Examples:**
- Diversity, equity, and inclusion training
- Racial bias in healthcare data analysis
- Social determinants of health in actuarial modeling

### 4. Modeling Bias
**Workshops on discrimination in machine learning and AI:**
- Testing models for fairness
- Identifying unintended bias
- Discrimination in ML/AI models

**Examples:**
- Fairness testing in healthcare ML models
- Unintended bias in predictive algorithms
- Discrimination detection in automated systems

### 5. Professional Webinars
**Qualifying webinars include:**
- "Fighting the Biases Creeping up in Models" (SOA, 2023)
- "Discrimination: Considerations for Machine Learning, AI Models, and Underlying Data" (AAA, 2024)
- "Actuarial View of Data Bias" (AAA, 2023)

## Implementation in Healthcare Analytics

This project demonstrates bias detection and mitigation techniques specifically applied to healthcare payer data, making it relevant for actuarial continuing education in the healthcare sector.

### Key Learning Objectives
1. Identify statistical biases in healthcare claims data
2. Recognize cognitive biases in actuarial decision-making
3. Understand social biases in healthcare data collection and analysis
4. Apply bias detection techniques to machine learning models
5. Implement fairness testing in healthcare analytics
